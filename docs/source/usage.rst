Installation
------------

To use Ampalibe, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install ampalibe

Creation of a new project
-------------------------

After installation, an ``ampalibe`` executable is available in your system path, 
and we will create our project with this command.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ampalibe create myfirstbot

There will be a created directory named **myfirstbot/** and all the files contained in it.

.. note::

   You can directly create projet without a new directory with **init** command

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd myExistingDirectory
   $ ampalibe init
